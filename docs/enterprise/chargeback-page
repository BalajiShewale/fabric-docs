# Understand the chargeback reporting

Fabric Chargeback app is designed to provide the ability to see the usage of capacities over different scenarios like metric types, dates, operation names etc. Users can drill-through to analyze more on workspace and item level.

You must be a capacity admin in order to install the Fabric chargeback app. Once installed, the app can be shared with any member of the organization with the necessary access permissions.

>[!NOTE]
>Items with same name can be present across workspaces and capacities with unique Item Ids. Repetition of same Item name can be seen in visuals if they have distinct Item Ids.

The Fabric chargeback report has five pages:

* **Chargeback**
* **Workspace Details**
* **Item Details**
* **Export Data**
* **Help**

This page provides utilization details of capacity, workspace and Items. Utilization refers to CU processing time in seconds required to complete any activity or action.
The term utilization % shows the ratio of utilization for selected scope or Item to the tenant level utilization.
